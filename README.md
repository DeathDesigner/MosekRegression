We created this package to support the experiments given in the paper by Schmelzer, Hauser, Dahl and Andersen.

You need to install Mosek before you can rerun those experiments or create your own ones. We refer to
http://mosek.com/resources/download/

Mosek is commercial software but you can evaluate the product using a 30-day license.

Mosek 7 comes with a new interface called Mosek Fusion. We make heavy use of this interface and solve problems
arising in quantitative finance.

We provide a setup.py and requirements.txt.

We have created some basic tests. They are available by running nosetests.

To install this package type python setup.py install.
